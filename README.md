## 🧪 Testing Plan
Each team member will contribute to testing based on their roles:

- Tester: Scrape Centennial Campaign Impact from XULA’s website.  
- SWE & Tester: Write 10 unit tests for the scraping function using JUnit 5 or unittest.  
- Designer & Lead: Implement one UML class and create at least 20 unit tests.  
- SWE: Implement a different UML class and create at least 10 unit tests.  

> Testing documentation and results will be added here once tests are implemented.



## 📜 Contributing Guidelines
The Software Engineer will create a `CONTRIBUTING.md` file outlining:  
- Branching and commit message conventions  
- How to run and test code locally  
- Issue creation and resolution process  
- Pull request review and merge procedures  
- Testing requirements before submitting commits  



## 🧾 License
A proper open-source LICENSE file will be created and committed to the repo.  
The team will select an appropriate license (MIT, Apache 2.0, or GPL) once the base repository setup is finalized.  

> All contributions will follow this license to maintain open-source compliance and credit authors appropriately.


## 📋 Issues & Workflow
Each team member will be assigned 5 issues after our kickoff meeting.  
The Lead and SWE will also generate 30 unassigned issues for continued development.
